        <p>Scientific research shows that global climate change is negativly affecting the animals of our planet. Global warming is causing extreme weather patterns such as droughts, heat waves, and forest fires. These patterns are making it so the animals cannot get the nutrients and shelter they need to survive. A study published in 2003 in Nature journal showed that 80% of 1,500 wild species are in danger due to global warming. With your help, we are now able to send these at risk animals into space where they are safe from harmful climate change. Thank you for your contributions from the EESPP staff and the animals you've helped.</p>
